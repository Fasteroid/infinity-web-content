# Two Faces, One Site
One repository for both Chromium and Awesomium versions of my Garry's Mod server web content.<br>
This is being worked on in preparation for the server donations system overhaul.

### If anything here feels outdated or messy, blame 32-bit gmod's embedded browser _Awesomium_.
 - It is **NOT** in fact "awesome" as the name would imply.
 - *GARRY PLEASE PUSH CHROMIUM TO MAIN ALREADY AHHHHHH*
